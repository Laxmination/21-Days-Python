## while Loops
<b>while Loops: </b>With while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. It can also execute it's block of code for unlimited amount of times.<br><br>
while condition :<br>
Some work 

## For Loop
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence. For loop executes it's block of code for a limited amount of times.

## Break and Continue

<b>Continue:</b> Terminates execution in the current iteration and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.

## range()
