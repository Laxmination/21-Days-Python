# Object Oriented Programming in Python

To map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code. This is called <b>Object oriented programming.</b>

## Python Classes/Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language.<br>
Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.<br>
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

### Class and instance Attributes
Class.attr<br>
obj.attr

### __ _init_ __() Function

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __ _init_ __() function.<br>
All classes have a function called __ _init_ __(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.<br>
<i>The __ _init_ __() function is called automatically everytime the class is being used to create a new object.</i>
