# What is Python?
Python is a simple language which is easy to learn. It is free and opensource high level language. We can use Python for various purpose like for web-Devlopment, Machine Learning, Data Science, software development, System scripting and so on.

# Character sets in Python
1. Alphabets: "A" to "Z" and "a" to "z".
2. Numbers: "0" to "9"
3. Symboles: "*", "+", "-", "/", "%" and so on.
4. WhiteSpaces: BlankSpace, Tab, carrage return, newline, formfeed.
5. Other Characters: Python can process all ASCII and Unicode characters as part of data or literals.<br> <br>

# Variables and dataTypes in Python
A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program
eg:Num = x; <br>
=>DataType-> int, variable-> Num, x-> value stored under the variable "Num" <br><br>

# Rules for identifiers
Identifiers are the words that are used to declare the name of variables.
1. Identifiers for variable can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or an underscore(_). So MYVariable, variable_1, Variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.
2. An Identifier can't start with digit i.e. 1variable is not valid and variable1 is valid.
3. We can't use special symboles like !, #, @, %, etc in identifier.
4. Identifier can be of any length.
# Data Types:
The words that shows the type of data stored in variable are dataTypes.
 Integers, String, Float, Boolean, None<br><br>
