# Day-1 
How to setup technologies in Computer for Python
1. Download Python from site "https://www.python.org/"
2. Download Visual studio Code from site "https://code.visualstudio.com/" <br> <br>

<b>What is Python?</b>
<p>Python is a simple language which is easy to learn. It is free and opensource high level language. We can use Python for various purpose like for web-Devlopment, Machine Learning, Data Science, software Development, System scripting and so on.</p> <br><br>

<b>Character sets in Python</b>
1. Alphabets: "A" to "Z" and "a" to "z".
2. Numbers: "0" to "9"
3. Symboles: "*", "+", "-", "/", "%" and so on.
4. WhiteSpaces: BlankSpace, Tab, carrage return, newline, formfeed.

<b>Variables and dataTypes in Python</b><br>
A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program
eg: int Num = x; <br>
=> int -> DataType, Num-> variable, x-> value stored under the variable "Num" <br><br>

<b>Rules for identifiers</b><br>
1. Identifiers for variavle can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or an underscore(_). So MYVariable, variable_1, Variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.
2. An Identifier can't start with digit i.e. 1variable is not valid and variable1 is valid.
3. We can't use special symboles like !, #, @, %, etc in identifier.
4. Identifier can be of any length.<br>
 <b>Data Types</b>
 Integers, String, Float, Boolean, None
