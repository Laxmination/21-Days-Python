# NumPy

## Introduction to NumPy
1. Numpy stands for "Numerical Python"
2. Numpy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in python.
3. Numpy is a python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects.
4. Numpy also has the functions for working in domain of linear algebra and matrices.

### Installation of Numpy
Syntex : pip install numpy  (on terminal)

### Import numpy

Syntex : import numpy as np

## Importance of NumPy
1. Wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.
2. It supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.
3. Mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statical operations, random simulation and much more.
