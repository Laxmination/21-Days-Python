# Rules for identifiers
Identifiers are the words that are used to declare the name of variables.
1. Identifiers for variable can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or an underscore(_). So MYVariable, variable_1, Variable_for_print all are valid python identifiers.
2. An Identifier can't start with digit i.e. 1variable is not valid and variable1 is valid.
3. We can't use special symboles like !, #, @, %, etc in identifier.
4. Identifier can be of any length.
# Data Types:
The words that shows the type of data stored in variable are dataTypes.
 Integers, String, Float, Boolean, None<br><br>
